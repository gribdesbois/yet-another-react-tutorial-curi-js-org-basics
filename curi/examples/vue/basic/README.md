# Basic Curi + Vue Example

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/vue/basic)

While Vue does have an official router, this project shows how you _could_ use Curi as the router for a Vue project instead. It uses `<curi-link>` component provided by the the `curi-vue` package.

**Note:** If you are experienced with Vue, you will probably notice that the layout of this application is not optimal. That is a just testament to my lack of familiarity with Vue and hopefully will be fixed as I learn the best practices. Please feel free to point out any issues and I will update this example.
